C1	Ovarian	Low-Grade Serous	2C73.02	A slow-growing serous adenocarcinoma that arises from the ovary. It usually originates from borderline neoplastic processes or adenofibromas. It is characterised by the presence of low grade cytologic features and infrequent mitotic figures.
C2	Ovarian	High-Grade Serous	2C73.03	Epithelial ovarian cancer that is highly agressive, highly metastatic, low survival rate, high recurrence rate
C3	Skin	Superficial Spreading Melanoma 	ICD-O Code 8743/3	Superficial Spreading Melanoma is the most common subtype 
C4	Skin	Lentigo Maligna Melanoma	ICD-O Code 8742/3	Lentigo Maligna Melanoma is often found in sun-damaged skin
C5	Skin	Nodular Melanoma	ICD-O Code 8721/3	Nodular Melanoma is known for its agressive nature
C6	Skin	Acral Lentiginous Melanoma 	ICD-O Code 8744/3	Acral Lentiginous Melanoma is known for occuring on palms, soles, or under nails
C7	Skin	Demoplastic Melanoma	ICD-O Code 8745/3	A rarer form with uniue features (e.g., scar-like appreance)
C8	Skin	Melanoma	ICD-10-CM Code C43.9	Originates in melanocytes, often appears in sun exposed areas but can also appear in unexposed areas. Can spread if not treated early
C9	Skin	Basel Cell Carcinoma (BBC)	ICD-10-CM Code C44.91	Common skin cancer type, typically found in the sun exposed spots such as face and neck. It rarely spreads but can cause significant local damage if not treated
C10	Prostate	Advanced prostate cancer	ICD-10 Code C61	Prostate cancer that has spread beyond the prostate to other parts of the body, often leading to more aggressive disease and a poorer prognosis
C11	Prostate	Castration-resistant prostrate cancer (CRPC)	ICD-10 Code C61	Prostate cancer that continues to grow and spread despite the lowering of testosterone levels
C13	Prostate	Prostate Cancer	ICD-10 Code C61	A type of cancer that occurs in the prostate, a small gland in the male reproductive system that produces seminal fluid, typically developing slowly over many years, often without symptoms in its early stages, and can range from slow-growing forms that may not require immediate treatment to aggressive types that spread to other parts of the body
C14	Prostate	Early Stage Prostate Cancer	ICD-10 Code C61	Localized to the prostate and has not yet spread to other tissues, usually detected through screening or when symptoms appear
C15	Prostate	Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (NEPC)	ICD-10 Code C61	An aggressive form of prostate cancer characterized by the presence of neuroendocrine cells
C16	Lung	Non-small cell; Adenocarcinoma; Never Smoker	2C25.0	A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterised by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells. This subtype is more common in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. While often asymptomatic, this cancer is frequently identified through screening or as an incidental finding in imaging studies. If clinical symptoms are present, they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever. Notably, this subtype occurs in individuals with no history of smoking, indicating other environmental or genetic factors may contribute.
C17	Lung	Non-small cell; Adenocarcinoma	2C25.0	A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterised by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells. This subtype is more common in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. While often asymptomatic, this cancer is frequently identified through screening or as an incidental finding in imaging studies. If clinical symptoms are present, they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever. Tobacco use is a major risk factor for developing this subtype, though it may also occur in non-smokers.
C18	Lung	Non-small cell; Adenocarcinoma; History of smoking 	2C25.0	A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterised by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells. This subtype is more common in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. While often asymptomatic, this cancer is frequently identified through screening or as an incidental finding in imaging studies. If clinical symptoms are present, they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever. A history of smoking significantly increases the risk for this subtype, highlighting the strong link between tobacco use and lung cancer development.
C20	Breast	Luminal A	2C6Z	A subtype of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Luminal A breast cancer cells typically have estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) proteins inside them and a small amount or none of a protein called HER2 on their surface. Luminal A breast cancer cells also tend to have low levels of a protein called Ki-67, which is found only in cells that are dividing. Under a microscope, luminal A breast cancer cells look more like normal cells than other subtypes of breast cancer. They tend to grow slowly and have a good prognosis. Most breast cancers are luminal A (National Cancer Institute)
C21	Breast	Luminal B	2C6Z	A subtype of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Luminal B breast cancer cells typically have estrogen receptor (ER) proteins but not progesterone receptor (PR) proteins inside them. The cancer cells may or may not have the HER2 protein on their surface. Luminal B breast cancer cells often have high levels of a protein called Ki-67, which is found only in cells that are dividing. Luminal B breast cancers tend to grow more quickly and have a slightly poorer prognosis than luminal A breast cancers. (National Cancer Institute)
C22	Breast	Basal-Like (Triple Negative)	2C6Z	Basal-like/ Triple negative breast cancers don’t have receptors for estrogen, progesterone and HER2.Typically high-grade, or aggressive. Many are diagnosed at a later stage when the cancer has already spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes or other organs. These tumours tend to spread to the bloodstream, brain or lungs more often than breast cancers that aren’t triple negative. They do not spread to the lymph nodes or the bones as often as other types of breast cancer. (Canadian Cancer Society)
C23	Breast	HER2 Overexpressing	2C6Z	HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is a fast-growing form of invasive breast cancer. If you have this kind of cancer, it means tests show high levels of a specific protein that manages how cells grow and divide That protein is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2. This type of breast cancer is likely to spread (metastasize) from your breast to other areas of your body. Healthcare providers can successfully cure HER2-positive breast cancer if it’s diagnosed before it spreads. (Mayo Clinic)
C24	Colorectal	Right-side 	2B90.0	This refers to colorectal cancer that originates in the cecum, ascending colon, and the right half of the transverse colon. (Colorectal Cancer Alliance)
C25	Colorectal	Left-side	2B90.1	Colorectal cancer that develops in the left side of the colon and rectum, specifically in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.
